	// 1. if an array does not initialized explicitly, then the default value of this array is 0.
	// 2. In an array you can find the length of the array using len() function.
	// 3. In an array if ellipsis "..." become visible at the place of length, then the length of the array is determined by the initialized elements.
	// 4. In an array you are allowed to iterate over the range of the elements of the array.
	// 5. In an array if the element type of the array is comparable, then the array type is also comparable. So we can directly compare two arrays using == operator.
